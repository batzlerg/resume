# Graham Batzler Resume

This is my personal resume, up to date as of late 2022.

It's written in plain HTML, CSS, and JS because although there are a lot of fun frontend tools out there, they're overkill for a single static page like this.

There's no build process, so I've made some (annotated) concessions to that fact in the source code. If you like reading about that sort of thing (tradeoffs, concessions, thought process at certain decision points), there are plenty of comments throughout the source code.

I keep an up-to-date PDF version in this repo, which is generated by uncommenting the print stylesheet and printing directly from a Chrome-based browser. As of the last update, I made sure it prints correctly in Firefox as well but there are some inconsistencies between layout defaults that make Chrome the preferred option.
